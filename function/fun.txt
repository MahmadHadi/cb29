Functions in C language
-----------------------------------
what is function ?
	-> function is named program which is used to perform specific task.
    -> for example in c language, we use 'printf' function to display message on screen. 
                                         'scanf' function is used to take input from user using keyboard.

    -> We should use one function to perform only one task.
        eg: printf function only prints some message on screen
	
	-> we can call function (run function) as many times as we need. 
	
	-> each function has name and at least one line of code in it however we can add many line of coding in function 
	-> function can also have inputs known as parameters or arguments.  it is optional function process input and may optionally return at most one output. 

Why we need function ? 
    -> To avoid repeated code { DRY } and make code more readable, we need to use function
    -> Like when we use variables to use a values as many time as we need, we use functions to use some code as many times as we need.

type of function
-----------------------------------
    built in function / library function 
        -> Functions which are available in c language is called built in function or library function such as printf, scanf, fflush(stdin) etc 

    user defined function (UDF)
        -> Functions created by us(developer) as per requirement is called user defined function.


how to create function { syntax }
-----------------------------------

	return_type function_name (datatype variable-name, [datatype variable-name...]) {
		
        // function - body - code 

	}
	
	function_name (parameters); 

	example 
	void printStar(int height) {
		
        printf("\n ****************************************************************** \n");

	}
	
how to call function / run function?
	syntax
		function-name(1, 3, 5, ...) 
example 
void main() {

	int h = 20;
	printStar(h); // calling function printStar to print astrik on new line 

}

return_type : 
    int, float, char, void
